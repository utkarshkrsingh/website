I'm **Utkarsh Kumar Singh**, a Golang developer passionate about building scalable and efficient systems.

- I develop backend systems and tools in **Golang**, focusing on concurrency, scalability, and real-time communication.

- Some of my projects include:
  - **GoParty** – A real-time watch party app with synchronized video playback and chat.  
    - [goparty-server](https://github.com/utkarshkrsingh/goparty-server) – Golang backend with WebSockets and JWT-based authentication.  
    - [goparty-client](https://github.com/utkarshkrsingh/goparty-client) – React + TypeScript frontend with TailwindCSS.
  - [Ripple](https://github.com/utkarshkrsingh/ripple) – A cross-platform build automation tool with parallel task execution.
  - [Snag](https://github.com/utkarshkrsingh/snag) – A lightweight file watcher to automate builds and executions.

- My tech stack includes **Golang, C++, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL**, and tools like **Docker, Git, and Linux**.

- I'm currently pursuing a **B.Tech in Electronics & Computer Science Engineering** at KIIT University.
