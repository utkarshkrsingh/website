I'm **Aakash Sen Sharma**, a Linux & Wayland enthusiast. I write open-source software.

- I maintain a lot of Wayland-related software([NextWM](https://github.com/waycrate/nextwm), [Wayshot](https://github.com/waycrate/wayshot), [Swhkd](https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd)...)

- I'm currently learning about the [Wayland protocol](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), and writing Wayland compositors/clients all of which are on my
GitHub under copyleft licenses.

- Most of my open-source work is on GitHub and [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~shinyzenith).

- Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:aakashsensharma@gmail.com) (my [PGP key](/pgp) is 0x6DD485917B553B7B).

- The source code of this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/shinyzenith/website).
