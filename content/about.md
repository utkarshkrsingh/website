I'm **Utkarsh Kumar Singh**, a C/C++ enthusiast who likes Linux a lot. I like to write open-source software.

- I maintain an AUR package named [TaskHub](https://github.com/utkarshkrsingh/taskhub.git). A cli-based to-do list written in C++ using SQLite database.
- I'm now learning C++ through project-based learning.
- Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:utkarshkrsingh@proton.me).
- The source code of this website is in the [GitHub](https://github.com/utkarshkrsingh/website.git).
