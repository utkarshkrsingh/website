So, you're thinking about installing Arch Linux on your laptop? Thatâ€™s awesome! Whether youâ€™re diving into Arch Linux for its flexibility, minimalism, or just for the pure challenge (because, letâ€™s face it, we Linux users love a challenge ðŸ˜„), youâ€™ve come to the right place.

In this guide, Iâ€™ll walk you through the entire process of installing Arch Linux on your laptopâ€”step by step. And donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ve got screenshots and clear instructions to help you every step of the way.

Ready? Letâ€™s get started!

## Why Arch Linux?
Before we dive into the technical stuff, let me tell you why people _love_ Arch Linux:
- **Control**: You get to decide every little thing that goes into your system. No bloatware, just what you want.
- **Learning**: Arch Linux doesnâ€™t hold your hand, but thatâ€™s the beauty of it. It helps you learn so much about how Linux really works.
- **Rolling release**: Youâ€™re always up to date with the latest and greatest software versions.

If that excites you, then keep readingâ€”weâ€™re about to set up Arch Linux on your laptop!

## What Youâ€™ll Need Before We Start 
Before we jump into the installation, hereâ€™s a quick checklist of what youâ€™ll need to ensure everything goes smoothly:

- **A Laptop (obviously! ðŸ˜„)** â€“ Make sure itâ€™s compatible with Linux (most modern laptops are).
- **Stable Internet Connection** â€“ Youâ€™ll need it to download the Arch Linux base system during installation.
- **A USB Drive (2GB or more)** â€“ I'm assuming that your have already created a bootable usb drive using arch-iso.
- **Backup Your Data** â€“ If you already have an operating system on your laptop and you want to replace it with Arch, please make sure to back up any important files. Weâ€™ll be wiping your disk!

Got all that ready? Awesome! Letâ€™s move on.

## Step 1: Boot from the USB Drive

Alright, now weâ€™re getting to the fun part! Itâ€™s time to boot your laptop from the USB (that I'm assuming, you have already created).

- Insert the USB drive into your laptop.
- Restart your laptop, and immediately start pressing the key to access the boot menu (this varies by manufacturer; common keys are F2, F12, ESC, or DEL).
- From the boot menu, select your USB drive.

Once you do this, youâ€™ll be greeted with the Arch Linux boot menu. ðŸŽ‰ Select the default option, and press Enter.

**Take a deep breath ðŸ˜Œâ€”youâ€™re about to enter the world of Arch Linux installation!** 

## Step 2: Connect to the Internet
Now that weâ€™re booted into the Arch environment, the first thing weâ€™ll want to do is connect to the internet. If youâ€™re using an Ethernet cable, you should already be connected (lucky you!). But if youâ€™re using Wi-Fi, letâ€™s get connected.
- Type `iwctl` and press **Enter**.
- Then run the following commands:
```bash
device list     # in most casses its `wlan0`
```
![arch-install03.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/rscQjMvK/arch-install03.jpg)
```
<device> list
```
![arch-install04.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/HsY67WwN/arch-install04.jpg)
```
station <device> connect <your-network-name>
```
![arch-install05.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/9FLJP31Q/arch-install05.jpg)
- Enter your Wi-Fi password when prompted.

To check if youâ€™re connected, you can ping a website:
```bash
ping utkarsh.is-a.dev
```
![arch-install06.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BvKpGj3j/arch-install06.jpg)
If you see responses, youâ€™re good to go!

## Step 3: Update Archlinux-keyrings
Before we start, we need to update the `archlinux-keyring` of the iso you are using. The `archlinux-keyring` is essential for verifying the authenticity of Arch Linux packages.
```bash
pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
```

![arch-install07.png](https://i.postimg.cc/c4kBgR4K/arch-install07.png)

## Step 4: Partition the Disk
Now, letâ€™s partition your hard drive. This part is where we divide your disk into separate sections for Arch to live on. You can use either `cfdisk` or `fdisk`â€”Iâ€™ll use `cfdisk` because itâ€™s a bit more user-friendly.

- First run the command `lsblk` to see what are the drive available to you.

![arch-install07-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RZ8d8ckr/arch-install07-1.png)
In my case it's `sda`, if you have `nvme0n1` on your screen, then this is what you are looking for. Remenber `sdb` is the usb you are using to boot in. Don't use it as your main disk.

- Now that we got our partner we can go forward. Use the following command to use `cfdisk` to partition your disk.
```bash
cfdisk /dev/sda             # if you have nvme0n1, replace sda with it
```
![arch-install07-2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/63x06B6Y/arch-install07-2.png)

- Now select the `free space` you have on your disk and select `new` on bottom left, then press **Enter** .

![arch-install07-3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/9MPBrsrV/arch-install07-3.png)

- Now, it will ask for how much space will this new partition will have. For this we will select `2G` i.e., 2 Gigabytes only for `UEFI` partition.

![arch-install07-4.png](https://i.postimg.cc/x803Hgzm/arch-install07-4.png)

- Then press **Enter** and select `Type` and again press **Enter**.
- In that menu, scroll up and select `UEFI System` and press **Enter**.

![arch-install07-5.png](https://i.postimg.cc/cCXMcYRb/arch-install07-5.png)

- Now you will get some `free space` and a `UEFI System` partition of 2 Gigabytes.
- Again select the `free space` and press **Enter**.
- This time leave the value it have, and press **Enter**.
- You will see a new partition of type `Linux filesystem`. That's good.
- Then select `write`, write yes and press **Enter**.

![arch-install07-6.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gcDDd9CH/arch-install07-6.png)

- Now quit.
- Run the command `lsblk` again, and you will see that now there is 2 more partitions under `sda` or `nvme0n1`.
```bash
lsblk
```

## Step 5: Format the Partitions
Next, weâ€™ll format the partitions to prepare them for use.

For the root partition (aka the bigger one):
```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 # or mount /dev/nvme0n1pX (for those who have nvme0n1, replace X with the respective number)
```

![arch-install07-7.png](https://i.postimg.cc/sDgJg6yd/arch-install07-7.png)

For the EFI partition (if applicable):
```bash
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1 # or mount /dev/nvme0n1pY (for those who have nvme0n1, replace Y with the respective number)
```

![arch-install08.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rwdCSDKf/arch-install08.png)

## Step 5: Mount the Partitions 
Now weâ€™ll mount the partitions so we can install Arch Linux onto them.

Mount the root partition:
```bash
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt # or mount /dev/nvme0n1pX /mnt (mount the bigger one to /mnt)
```

![arch-install09.png](https://i.postimg.cc/7Zp1Xqzw/arch-install09.png)

To check whether the mounting is correct or not again run `lsblk` command.

![arch-install10.png](https://i.postimg.cc/g08VT1yR/arch-install10.png)

If you have an EFI partition:
```bash
mkdir /mnt/boot # first create the boot directory in /mnt
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot # then mount the EFI partition to /mnt/boot
```

![arch-install12.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rm9S8WPw/arch-install12.png)
![arch-install13.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Wzb0t3B6/arch-install13.png)

## Step 6: Install the Base System 
Now that our partitions are set up and mounted, itâ€™s time to install the base system. This is where the magic happens! Weâ€™ll be using the `pacstrap` command to install the essential packages.

Run the following command:
```bash
pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel linux-zen linux-firmware sof-firmware intel-ucode sudo nano bluez bluez-utils networkmanager
```

![arch-install14.png](https://i.postimg.cc/BbYHF3sW/arch-install14.png)

If it asks to select some package, just press **Enter** and use the default one. 

![arch-install15.png](https://i.postimg.cc/G3qkVFDM/arch-install15.png)

This command installs the base Arch Linux system, along with the Linux kernel and firmware necessary for your hardware.

## Step 7: Generate fstab
Next, we need to create the filesystem table (fstab), which helps the system know how to mount the partitions during boot.
```bash
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

This command generates the fstab file automatically based on your partitions.

## Step 8: Chroot into the System
Weâ€™re almost there! Now, we need to change the root directory to the new system we just installed.

Run:
```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

Youâ€™ll now be inside your newly installed Arch environment! ðŸŽ‰

![arch-install20.png](https://i.postimg.cc/SKF8CD0K/arch-install20.png)
The path will be changed, if you are inside the installed arch environment.

## Step 9: Create Root Password 
Now that you entered the environment you need to create a root password.
Run:
```bash
passwd 
```
![arch-install21.png](https://i.postimg.cc/k5QScK9v/arch-install21.png)

## Step 10: Create Username and Password
Now we need to create a user and it's password just like we do on windows.
Run:
```bash
useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power,video,audio -s /bin/bash utkarsh # replace "urkarsh" with your Username
```
To create it's password, run:
```bash
passwd utkarsh # again replace utkarsh with your Username
```

## Step 11: Give the User Powers
In this step we will give the user (i.e. you) administrative powers. Sounds cool nah ðŸ‘».
Run:
```bash
EDITOR=nano visudo
```
Uncomment the following line (by removing '#'):
![arch-install25.png](https://i.postimg.cc/05Wwc8gF/arch-install25.png)
And save by pressing `Ctrl-o` and **Enter**  and again `Ctrl-x`.

## Step 12: Set the Time Zone and Localization
Now letâ€™s configure your time zone. This is important to make sure your clock is set correctly.
- Set your time zone by creating a symbolic link. For example, if you're in India:
```bash
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime
```
Replace Asia/Kolkata with your relevant time zone. You can find it in [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page).

- Run:
```bash
hclock --systohc
```
Next, weâ€™ll set the localization. This ensures your system uses the correct language and settings.

- Open the locale.gen file:
```bash
nano /etc/locale.gen 
```
Uncomment `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` and any other locales you want to use by removing the # at the start of the line.
![arch-install34.png](https://i.postimg.cc/1tWfCKdw/arch-install34.png)
To save press `Ctrl-o` and press **Enter** and to exit press `Ctrl-x`.

- Generate the locales:
```bash
locale-gen
```

- Set the `LANG` variable:
```bash
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.conf
```

## Step 13: Set Hostname and Localdomain
Letâ€™s set up your hostname! This is the name your laptop will use on the network.

Run:
```bash
echo "archlinux" >> /etc/hostname # replace "archlinux" as your choice
```

For localdomain run:
```bash
echo "127.0.0.1      localdomain" >> /etc/hosts
echo "::1            localdomain" >> /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.1.1      archlinux.localdomain      archlinux" >> /etc/hosts # replace "archlinux" with your Hostname
```

## Step 14: Install and Configure the Bootloader
Weâ€™re almost done! Now, letâ€™s install the bootloader so you can boot into your new Arch Linux system.
- First install `grub`, `efibootmgr`, `dosfstools` and `mtools`
```bash
pacman -S grub efibootmgr dosfstools mtools
```

- For UEFI systems, run:
```bash
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Step 15: Installing Desktop Manager
A desktop manager must be installed for the GUI (Graphical User Interface) to function. One of the most well-known characters is Gnome.

Run:
```bash
pacman -S gnome 
```

## Step 16: Sound Systems 
To enable sound control in archlinux, we need to install `pipewire` and dependencies related to it. Let's install it.

Run:
```bash
pacman -S pipewire pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse wireplumber
systemctl --user --now enable pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
```

## Step 17: Enabling Service 
Now that we are done with installation, we need to start the networkmanager and bluetooth services.

Run:
```bash
systemctl enable bluetooth && systemctl enable NetworkManager # "NetworkManager" not "networkmanger" for enabling it 
systemctl enable gdm
```

## Step 18: Unmount & Reboot
Now that installation is completely over, we need to carefully umount the drives.

Run:
```bash
exit # to come out of Chroot
umount -lR /mnt
reboot 
```
