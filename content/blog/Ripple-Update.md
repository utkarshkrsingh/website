Itâ€™s been an incredible journey building Ripple from the ground up. What started as a simple ideaâ€”creating a more intuitive and cross-platform build automation toolâ€”has now become a functional reality. Ripple is no longer just an idea; itâ€™s a tool that simplifies task automation, making it more accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.

## What Ripple Achieves
Ripple now supports Linux, macOS, and Windows, staying true to its goal of being a truly cross-platform alternative to GNU Make. One of its core strengths is how it automatically executes dependent tasks before running the main task, ensuring that project dependencies are always in place before execution. With ripple.toml, a simple configuration file placed in the root of each project, users can define their build steps in an intuitive wayâ€”no complex syntax, no unnecessary learning curve.

## The Road Ahead
Although Ripple has reached a solid working state, this is just the beginning. There are many optimizations and features I plan to implement. The long-term vision is to make Ripple a powerful yet easy-to-use automation tool that fits seamlessly into any development workflow. I also hope to involve more contributors in the project, expanding its capabilities and refining it through community collaboration.

If youâ€™re a developer passionate about build systems, automation, or simply curious to contribute to an open-source project, I invite you to join me in shaping Rippleâ€™s future. The possibilities are endless, and together, we can build something remarkable.

With that, Iâ€™m signing off from this chapter of Rippleâ€™s story. But stay tunedâ€”this is only the beginning!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
