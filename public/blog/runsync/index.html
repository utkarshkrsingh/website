	<p>I recently started working on a project and generally use Neovim as my code editor. However, I had to exit Neovim to compile and run my code, then reopen it, which became inconvenient. To streamline the process, I came up with an idea for a program that monitors a specified directory for file modifications. If any file is modified, it checks the file type against a config file. If a match is found, it automatically compiles and runs the file.</p>
<p>I chose Go as the language for this project. Since I am currently learning it, this project gives me valuable insight into system-level programming in Go. I named the program &ldquo;runsync&rdquo;—not the best name, but it serves the purpose. At this stage, runsync doesn’t support a config file and only works with Python, Go, C, and C++. Support for a config file is planned for a future release. I haven’t considered cross-platform compatibility yet, so I’m not sure if I’ll make it compatible with Windows or macOS.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-runsync-use-under-the-hood-">What does runsync use under the hood ?</h4>
<p>There is a Linux service called <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a>, which monitors every directory in the file system and keeps track of the files within it. All file explorers use it to manage file accessibility. I used <a href="https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify">fsnotify</a>, a Go module that provides bindings for inotify, enabling its use in Go. Additionally, I used <a href="https://github.com/fatih/color">fatih/color</a>, a module that adds color to terminal text.</p>
<h4 id="what-do-i-think-about-runsync-">What do I think about runsync ?</h4>
<p>It’s a great project for Linux users who want to gain a deeper understanding of how file systems work in Linux. I believe anyone using Linux should try coding a similar program in the language of their choice. While runsync may seem simple at first glance, it has a depth that makes it an interesting project. In the end, I encourage everyone to give it a try and see how far they can take it. Creating new programs is the core purpose of a programmer, and making it exceptional adds a personal touch as a skilled programmer. Thank you. I will keep you updated on the progress of this project.</p>
