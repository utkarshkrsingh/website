      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started working on a project and generally use Neovim as my code editor. However, I had to exit Neovim to compile and run my code, then reopen it, which became inconvenient. To streamline the process, I came up with an idea for a program that monitors a specified directory for file modifications. If any file is modified, it checks the file type against a config file. If a match is found, it automatically compiles and runs the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Go as the language for this project. Since I am currently learning it, this project gives me valuable insight into system-level programming in Go. I named the program &amp;ldquo;runsync&amp;rdquo;—not the best name, but it serves the purpose. At this stage, runsync doesn’t support a config file and only works with Python, Go, C, and C++. Support for a config file is planned for a future release. I haven’t considered cross-platform compatibility yet, so I’m not sure if I’ll make it compatible with Windows or macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-does-runsync-use-under-the-hood-&#34;&gt;What does runsync use under the hood ?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Linux service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html&#34;&gt;inotify&lt;/a&gt;, which monitors every directory in the file system and keeps track of the files within it. All file explorers use it to manage file accessibility. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify&#34;&gt;fsnotify&lt;/a&gt;, a Go module that provides bindings for inotify, enabling its use in Go. Additionally, I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fatih/color&#34;&gt;fatih/color&lt;/a&gt;, a module that adds color to terminal text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-do-i-think-about-runsync-&#34;&gt;What do I think about runsync ?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a great project for Linux users who want to gain a deeper understanding of how file systems work in Linux. I believe anyone using Linux should try coding a similar program in the language of their choice. While runsync may seem simple at first glance, it has a depth that makes it an interesting project. In the end, I encourage everyone to give it a try and see how far they can take it. Creating new programs is the core purpose of a programmer, and making it exceptional adds a personal touch as a skilled programmer. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
